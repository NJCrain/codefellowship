# CodeFellowShip
An app that allows users to sign up through a form, which will hash their passwords and store them to a database. After signing up, the user is taken to a page showing them a detailed view of their account. Users can sign in to an account, and create posts on their own profile if desired. They can also view posts on another users profile.
